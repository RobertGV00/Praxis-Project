        This is a feminist praxis project, theory turned into public action. It takes intersectional feminist concepts from class and applies them
        to popular media in a practical way, through tools, case studies, and interactive tests that anyone can use.

      <h2>What this project does</h2>
      <p>
        A big frustration in feminist media studies is that many people do not recognize these patterns, and institutions can keep repeating them
        because the audience has not been trained to notice. This website is designed to raise awareness, not through vague opinions,
        but through structured analysis that connects representation to power.

        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            Gaze theory helps explain how visual storytelling can make some characters feel like full subjects and others feel like objects.
            It is not only about the camera, it is also about narrative focus, perspective, editing, and who gets interiority.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the gaze is biased, viewers learn to normalize unequal power, especially around gender.

        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            The Man Box describes the narrow expectations placed on men, be tough, be dominant, reject femininity, do not show emotion,
            and prove manhood through control. Media often rewards these norms and frames them as heroic.
          </p>
          <p>
            This harms everyone, it reinforces sexism, violence, shame, and emotional disconnection.

        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            Intersectional feminism shows that gender is never experienced alone. Race, class, sexuality, disability, and nationality
            shape whose stories are centered and whose bodies are treated as disposable.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project highlights not just who appears in media, but who is granted agency, depth, and protection.

      <h2>How gaze and the Man Box connect</h2>
      <p>
        The gaze and the Man Box reinforce each other. The gaze often positions women as visual reward, decoration, or obstacle,
        while the Man Box positions men as subjects whose desire and dominance drive the story. When films normalize that structure,
        they teach audiences that control is natural, consent is negotiable, and women exist to be watched.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is why this site treats them as one system. If you only analyze representation without analyzing masculinity norms,
        you miss half the mechanism. If you only analyze masculinity norms without analyzing gaze, you miss how the visual economy sustains power.

            Who gets close ups that build interiority, who gets fragmented shots, who is framed as powerful, who is framed as available.
            If women are shown mainly as bodies and men as decision makers, the gaze is shaping a power hierarchy.

            Who makes decisions that change the plot, who is allowed to fail and recover, who is punished for ambition,
            and who is rewarded for dominance. This is where representation becomes structural, not cosmetic.

        Praxis means the analysis does not stay private. Use the results to create an Instagram post, a class discussion prompt, a mini review,
        or a short public explainer that helps other people see these patterns. Awareness is not everything, but without awareness there is no pressure for change.
