      <p class="subtitle">Theory plus practice, visible and deliberate action</p>
      <p class="hero-description">
        This website was created as a feminist praxis project. Praxis means applying intersectional feminist theory in practical ways that reach the public.
        The goal is to raise consciousness, question institutions of power, and create tools that help people analyze pop culture with structure and clarity.

      <h2>Method, how the site is organized</h2>
      <p>
        The site is divided into a conceptual lab, a masculinity framework, and interactive tools. The Movie Gaze Lab explains how visual storytelling can create
        objectification and unequal power. The Man Box page explains how pop culture trains masculinity through dominance, emotional silence, and control.
        The Tests and Tools page turns these concepts into structured analysis with scores and recommendations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core idea is connection. Gaze analysis shows how women are positioned visually and narratively. Man Box analysis shows how masculinity is rewarded and normalized.
        Intersectionality shows how power works differently depending on race, class, sexuality, and ability. When these frameworks are combined, patterns become visible
        and critique becomes more than personal taste.

      <h2>Academic integrity and fair use</h2>
      <p>
        This project references films and media that already exist. Posters and titles are used under fair use for criticism, commentary, and education.
        The site does not claim ownership of those media objects. Its purpose is analysis, not distribution.
